<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Minneapolis, MN  USA</em> – Infinite Graphics Incorporated (IGI) has produced a wide variety of calibration masks used by manufacturers to calibrate their Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs).  These phototools can vary in size from 0.3” x 0.3” all the way up to 32” x 32” depending on the specific requirements.  All calibration masks produced by IGI are guaranteed to be NIST traceable ensuring the customer pinpoint accuracy and total reliability.  The ability to do large calibration masks (32” x 32”) puts Infinite Graphics Incorporated in a unique position to offer a product that can be difficult to find.<span id="more-421"></span></p>
<p>IGI offers a wide range of substrates and coatings.  Substrate offerings include: soda lime, fused silica, quartz, borosilicate, BK7, sapphire, opal glass and Mylar®.  Coating offerings include: iron oxide, chrome (bright and anti-reflective), aluminum and emulsion.  Easy release coatings include: X-301 and SLP-10.  IGI is even willing to customize substrates as well as work with customer provided substrates, if necessary.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our ability to produce a 32” x 32” calibration mask is really worth mentioning because many companies cannot offer that service,” Rob Larsen, Infinite Graphics Incorporated’s Vice-President of Engineering, states directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All of our calibration masks are NIST traceable and we complement these high quality standards with outstanding customer service, delivery time and ongoing customer support.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Minneapolis, MN USA</i> – Generate Solder Paste Stencil is a revolutionary software program that is available as part of Infinite Graphics Incorporated’s Phototooling Toolbox, a highly customizable suite of software solutions that function as a general hierarchical editing tool.</p>
<p>Generate Solder Paste Stencil software finds components and/or devices on a circuit board, integrates an assembly house’s specifications along with a unique customer’s set of design rules and then makes the necessary edits in a highly automated process. The software actually gets “smarter” as the customer uses the program thanks to a component library that tracks each and every project the customer loads into the system, identifying previously encountered components in the next project to speed up the process. Without Generate Solder Paste Stencil, manual edits can take hours or days of expensive engineering time. Thanks to the automation provided by Generate Solder Paste Stencil, it can be seconds for the actual modifications and minutes for review.<span id="more-422"></span></p>
<p>A wide range of edits in the package include: automatic home plate, C-shaped and D-shaped pad generation, shifting, shrinking and growing by an amount or percent, heel and toe locking, and independent width and length edits based on original or adjusted pads. Edits can be set to round all corners on stencil geometry, set gaps for passive pairs, apply multiple edits with a single click, apply the same edits to standard and associated pads and apply a variety of window-pane belly pad edits. The software’s supported inputs include: RS-274X, RS-274D, DXF, DWG, GDSII, ODB++ and DPF.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We are really saving these companies an enormous amount of time and money with this software&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Andy Kaske, Sales Associate with Infinite Graphics Incorporated, states emphatically.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The component library feature allows the Generate Solder Paste Stencil software to get ‘smarter’ with each completed project and each successive project becomes faster as a result. The efficiency created is staggering and leads to tremendous cost savings for the customer.”</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Minneapolis, MN USA – Infinite Graphics Incorporated, a recognized global leader in the Medium Area Mask (MAM) market, purchased a state-of-the-art Heidelberg Volume Pattern Generator (VPG), a large area lithography system. The technology offers substrates up to 800 x 800 mm, structures down to .8um and an address grid down to 20nm. The company also upgraded two Direct Write Lasers (DWL) imaging systems bringing the total to four imaging systems in Minneapolis and two in Singapore.<span id="more-426"></span></p>
<blockquote><p>“To offer quicker turn with smaller features, smaller defects and cleaner masks, we also purchased two additional Automatic Optical Inspection (AOI) systems giving us a total of five inspection systems in Minneapolis and another semiconductor quality MAM cleaner,” Clifford Stritch, Infinite Graphics Incorporated’s CEO, states directly. “These new systems will find sub-micron defects on masks to 14” and one micron defects on larger masks to 24” x 32”. The AOI can inspect to CAD data, compare die to die or inspect to design rules.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Pete Maitland, Infinite Graphics Incorporated’s Sales Manager, views this investment as a whole rather than as individual parts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“What this means from a sales perspective for us is that we now have a second complete line that allows us to service our customers with smaller features, tighter tolerances and cleaner masks in much quicker fashion. There are very few competitors that can match this capability and we look forward to providing these services to new and existing customers as a result of this investment.”</p></blockquote>
