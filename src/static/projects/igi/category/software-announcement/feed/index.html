										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Version 2.10 of IGI’s PT Viewer (<a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/igi-pt-viewer-free-download/">free download</a>), includes many updated input and editing features. Although the free version does not enable you to save or export, it does give you control over <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/dxf-dwg-viewing-and-editing/">input settings for DXF/DWG data</a>, using RealDWG® Technology making it a great free viewer for DXF or DWG data. IGI PT Viewer accepts many other data formats, including <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/rs274x-viewing-and-editing/">RS274X (Gerber)</a>, <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/gdsii-viewing-and-editing/">GDS II</a>, and <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/odb-viewing-and-editing/">ODB++</a>.</p>
<p>PT Viewer gives you a full range of editing options, enabling you to verify data by making measurements, running touch tests, counting, zooming and scrolling for visual inspections, checking for self-overlapping polygons, calculating areas and perimeters. You can also cleanup and optimize your data for further visual inspection. All of these features are built on IGI’s flexible and powerful editing tools. Visit our <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoresources/">Resources </a>page for tutorials to show you the basics.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the new features that will simplify your CAD work.</p>
<p><strong>Pick Filter Tool</strong> – a new Perimeter value was added to the Pick Filter tool. Now you can quickly pick all cases of a polygon or complex polygon at any rotation or position in the job. No more hunting them down in a dense job. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p><span id="more-2494"></span></p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Pick Filter</strong> tool and then pick one case of the polygon. This loads the filter with all relevant information, including the perimeter value. Now click the <strong>All</strong> picking tool to pick all cases of the polygon. This case shows how simple it is to pick all cases of two different polygon shapes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/01/PickFilter.mp4" controls="controls" width="671" height="671"></video></figure>
<p><strong>High Layer Support </strong>– now more than 100 files may be input at one time. With an industry trend toward higher layer counts, you may find this useful in your viewer. Further support for high layer editing requires a licensed purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Register Layer </strong>&#8211; includes a new option to make copies at the same time you register a layer. Use this option to fill out a stepped outline with rotated, mirrored, or scaled copies of the registered data, using a single command. Now you’re ready to check spacing with measurement tools and perform visual inspection of the entire layout. Exporting is disabled in PT Viewer, but many Export options are available with the purchase of a license. PT Viewer’s help shows all the settings and conversion options for exports.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror / Rotate / Scale</strong> – in a related enhancement, a simplified method of positioning transformed geometry or transformed copies of geometry was added to enable quick placement of rotated, mirrored and scaled geometry. Again, this is useful for filling out stepped layouts. After selecting the desired transformations, this complex edit has been simplified to 3 quick steps: A) pick the geometry, B) select a location related to the current location, such as a corner mark, C) select the destination for the transformed geometry.</p>
<p>The new version of PT Viewer extends your license until November 28, 2019.</p>
<p>(Version 2.10 has been available since November 30, 2019. If you downloaded after that, you already have it!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>To download the update: </h3>
<ol>
<li>1. Go to the <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/igi-pt-viewer-free-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGI PT Viewer page</a>, and click on the Returning Users button. </li>
<li>2. Enter your User Name (or email) and Password. <strong>If your last download was before January 4, 2019, sign in with your email address and use the “Lost your password?” option to reset your password. </strong>Then log in, with the new password.</li>

&#8211; Original method of running Specifications after rule assignment by Rule Level is still available.<br />
&#8211; Specifications are automatically updated with Edit Rule or Filter changes.<br />
&#8211; Review Filters are now included for common tasks. For example, show only components with Area &amp; Aspect Ratio Violations.<br />
&#8211; Tolerance options were added for Filters which use numerical values in their criteria.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Significant speed enhancements</strong> for some edits and smoother processing of Specifications.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>A sample Stencil job</strong> is now included with the software.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The use of CDR16 Technology, combined with advanced internal program development, has significantly improved the speed of operations in areas such as reading in data, Area Calculation, Generate Soldermask Expose, Generate Solder Paste Stencil and Component Server Startup. While improvements vary by system processor types and the process being run, early time tests showed speeds improved 30% -200%.<span id="more-409"></span></p>
<p>Built in filtering for components becomes a powerful tool when paired with edit rules, to create Specifications which are tailored to your customer’s requirements. Specifications can be applied with a click, and those edits are consistently and automatically finished. Implementing an IGI Rule Server to manage edit rules, filters and specifications brings new speed, flexibility and control to multi-user systems. Named edits provide a new way to substitute geometry, or run a series of commands to edit non-parametric geometry or full components.</p>
<p>A new Data Separation feature handles those multiple layer output tasks with the same speed and consistency of any other edit rule assignment. Options to create extents box layers and offsets, as well as component geometry layers, combined with the review and adjustment tools, make this kind of data separation a breeze.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The latest version of Infinite Graphics Incorporated’s Stencil Generation software, Version 1.32, uses advanced technology to provide Area Ratio and Aspect Ratio calculations for stencil apertures on the fly. Out-of-spec apertures are flagged during editing, enabling you to rework them immediately.</p>
<p>CDR12 Technology offers an enhanced recognition of component footprints at all angles. Free Angle Edits enable a wider range of edit rules to be applied to angled geometry globally.</p>
<p>In addition to your customized set of edit rules, which create stencil geometry from your component data, Version 1.32 offers an editing tool that takes it steps further. The Full Component Editor strengthens the stencil editing even further by accommodating special cases.</p>
<p>These new features of Version 1.32, offer greater reliability, flexibility and consistency, significantly reducing editing and delivery time to customers.</p>
