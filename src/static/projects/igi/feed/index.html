										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Version 2.10 of IGI’s PT Viewer (<a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/igi-pt-viewer-free-download/">free download</a>), includes many updated input and editing features. Although the free version does not enable you to save or export, it does give you control over <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/dxf-dwg-viewing-and-editing/">input settings for DXF/DWG data</a>, using RealDWG® Technology making it a great free viewer for DXF or DWG data. IGI PT Viewer accepts many other data formats, including <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/rs274x-viewing-and-editing/">RS274X (Gerber)</a>, <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/gdsii-viewing-and-editing/">GDS II</a>, and <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/odb-viewing-and-editing/">ODB++</a>.</p>
<p>PT Viewer gives you a full range of editing options, enabling you to verify data by making measurements, running touch tests, counting, zooming and scrolling for visual inspections, checking for self-overlapping polygons, calculating areas and perimeters. You can also cleanup and optimize your data for further visual inspection. All of these features are built on IGI’s flexible and powerful editing tools. Visit our <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoresources/">Resources </a>page for tutorials to show you the basics.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at some of the new features that will simplify your CAD work.</p>
<p><strong>Pick Filter Tool</strong> – a new Perimeter value was added to the Pick Filter tool. Now you can quickly pick all cases of a polygon or complex polygon at any rotation or position in the job. No more hunting them down in a dense job. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p><span id="more-2494"></span></p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Pick Filter</strong> tool and then pick one case of the polygon. This loads the filter with all relevant information, including the perimeter value. Now click the <strong>All</strong> picking tool to pick all cases of the polygon. This case shows how simple it is to pick all cases of two different polygon shapes.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-video aligncenter"><video src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2019/01/PickFilter.mp4" controls="controls" width="671" height="671"></video></figure>
<p><strong>High Layer Support </strong>– now more than 100 files may be input at one time. With an industry trend toward higher layer counts, you may find this useful in your viewer. Further support for high layer editing requires a licensed purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Register Layer </strong>&#8211; includes a new option to make copies at the same time you register a layer. Use this option to fill out a stepped outline with rotated, mirrored, or scaled copies of the registered data, using a single command. Now you’re ready to check spacing with measurement tools and perform visual inspection of the entire layout. Exporting is disabled in PT Viewer, but many Export options are available with the purchase of a license. PT Viewer’s help shows all the settings and conversion options for exports.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror / Rotate / Scale</strong> – in a related enhancement, a simplified method of positioning transformed geometry or transformed copies of geometry was added to enable quick placement of rotated, mirrored and scaled geometry. Again, this is useful for filling out stepped layouts. After selecting the desired transformations, this complex edit has been simplified to 3 quick steps: A) pick the geometry, B) select a location related to the current location, such as a corner mark, C) select the destination for the transformed geometry.</p>
<p>The new version of PT Viewer extends your license until November 28, 2019.</p>
<p>(Version 2.10 has been available since November 30, 2019. If you downloaded after that, you already have it!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>To download the update: </h3>
<ol>
<li>1. Go to the <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/cadcam-software/igi-pt-viewer-free-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGI PT Viewer page</a>, and click on the Returning Users button. </li>
<li>2. Enter your User Name (or email) and Password. <strong>If your last download was before January 4, 2019, sign in with your email address and use the “Lost your password?” option to reset your password. </strong>Then log in, with the new password.</li>

<p style="padding-left: 90px;">&#8211; Now run Specifications from the start of the Gen Stencil process, enabling the application of edits, without individual component &#8212; rule assignments from the selected Rule Location Level.<br />
&#8211; Original method of running Specifications after rule assignment by Rule Level is still available.<br />
&#8211; Specifications are automatically updated with Edit Rule or Filter changes.<br />
&#8211; Review Filters are now included for common tasks. For example, show only components with Area &amp; Aspect Ratio Violations.<br />
&#8211; Tolerance options were added for Filters which use numerical values in their criteria.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>Significant speed enhancements</strong> for some edits and smoother processing of Specifications.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>A sample Stencil job</strong> is now included with the software.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Editor Enhancements and New Features (PT and Gen Stencil)</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><strong>High Layer Count</strong> &#8212; Editing supports up to 999 manufacturing layers, for a total of 1022 unique graphical layers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When clients require detailed reporting for stencils, it can be hard to find the time and resources to calculate the detailed data, report it nicely, and make the graphical labels which reference the report. Calculations, such as area and aspect ratios for apertures, or total volumes and areas can be tricky, leaving you open to errors.</p>
<p><a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/gen-stencil/">Gen Stencil 2.10</a> combines customized spreadsheet reports with an Auto Label feature to create the documentation for you, with accuracy and speed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2310 size-full" src="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/09/AutoLabRept.jpg" alt="Graphic of Gen Stencil report with Auto Label" width="1451" height="639" srcset="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/09/AutoLabRept.jpg 1451w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/09/AutoLabRept-300x132.jpg 300w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/09/AutoLabRept-768x338.jpg 768w, http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshowp-content/uploads/2018/09/AutoLabRept-1024x451.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1451px) 100vw, 1451px" /></p>
<p>Customize reports with your corporate branding, or use one of the report templates, as is. Adjust the reported information as you see fit, reporting only part of the job, or filtering by<span id="more-2311"></span> aperture or component type. Include as much or as little detail as you need. Tailor the reports to the job type, or to the customer, or keep them standard, facility wide.</p>
<p>The information in the report comes directly from the data, improving accuracy and consistency.  Report the edits applied to the apertures. Report aperture counts, dimensions, area/aspect ratios, quantities before and/or after apertures are modified. Report area and volume measurements from the data. Report aperture locations, if desired. Report any apertures which were not processed by Gen Stencil.</p>
<p>Callout labeling is done automatically – generating and placing the graphic callouts, as well as using the precise label references from the report. No more manually created arrows and text that must be arranged and fit into the drawing. Gen Stencil’s Auto Label does that for you, instantly. Callout references are stored on a separate graphical layer for easy show/hide, and simple updating for reorders.</p>
<p>Both the custom spreadsheets and labeling features offer a great deal of flexibility in settings. Report only necessary data. Once you have them set as desired, you can run them on any job, with a couple of clicks.</p>
<p>So don’t struggle with documentation, present accurate stencil reports to your customer with clearly labeled apertures. Show them the critical aperture information for their job, using <a href="http://OFFLINEZIP.wpshoproducts-services/gen-stencil/">Gen Stencil’s</a> custom spreadsheets and Auto Label.</p>

<p>Do you make the same aperture edit over and over again? Recalculating for each case and each rotation? In each job?</p>
<p>We think there is a better way. More than just one better way.</p>
<p>In 2015, Gen Stencil made it easy to apply consistent edits to apertures by rule, using their unique component footprints to apply edits automatically. But sometimes your edit schemes are more broad. For example, change all 0402s to a homeplate, reduce width and length, and radius the corners. Or set pad widths for all fine pitch ICs to 45% of their pitches.</p>
<p>IGI added a feature called Specifications to handle edits just this way: applying sets of edits to groups of features.Edits are applied according to your spec., on the whole stencil, consistently and at any rotation. <span id="more-2089"></span></p>
<p>Build a Specification by pairing aperture filters with edits. Arrange them by priority and select an overwrite status. Then, make all the edits with the push of a button – now, and later for the next job.</p>
<p>We’ve found the Specifications feature to be so useful, we’re moving it up front and giving you more powerful options. In the 2.04 release, due out in July, you can maximize your automatic edits from the start. You choose the way that works best for your jobs &#8212; rule based or running specifications – or maybe a combination of both.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The use of CDR16 Technology, combined with advanced internal program development, has significantly improved the speed of operations in areas such as reading in data, Area Calculation, Generate Soldermask Expose, Generate Solder Paste Stencil and Component Server Startup. While improvements vary by system processor types and the process being run, early time tests showed speeds improved 30% -200%.<span id="more-409"></span></p>
<p>Built in filtering for components becomes a powerful tool when paired with edit rules, to create Specifications which are tailored to your customer’s requirements. Specifications can be applied with a click, and those edits are consistently and automatically finished. Implementing an IGI Rule Server to manage edit rules, filters and specifications brings new speed, flexibility and control to multi-user systems. Named edits provide a new way to substitute geometry, or run a series of commands to edit non-parametric geometry or full components.</p>
<p>A new Data Separation feature handles those multiple layer output tasks with the same speed and consistency of any other edit rule assignment. Options to create extents box layers and offsets, as well as component geometry layers, combined with the review and adjustment tools, make this kind of data separation a breeze.</p>
